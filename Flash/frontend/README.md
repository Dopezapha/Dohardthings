## Components

- `Dashboard`: Displays contract statistics
- `Deposit`: Allows users to deposit tokens
- `Withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw tokens
- `FlashLoan`: Interface for executing flash loans
- `Governance`: Allows users to create proposals, vote, and execute decisions
- `AdminPanel`: Interface for admin functions (managing borrowing limits, supported tokens)

## State Management

The application uses React Context for global state management. The `UserContext` provides user authentication state across the application.

## Styling

Styling is done using CSS modules. The main styles are in `src/styles/index.css`, with component-specific styles in their respective files.

## Testing

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production files.

## Deployment

1. Build the project as described above.
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` directory to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).

For Netlify or Vercel, you can connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to your fork
